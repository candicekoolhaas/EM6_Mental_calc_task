# EM6_Mental_calc_task
EDIT: Just realized that I can't upload pretty much any of my data files here because of the size limit. So, scratch this - not using github!
OLD: This repo will hold the data and files for processing, visualizing, and analyzing the eyetracking data from the mental calculation task in the EM6 project, from the pilot that was run in the fall of 2024.
